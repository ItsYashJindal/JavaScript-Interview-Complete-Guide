What is server ?
-   A server is a system that receives requests from clients and responds with data, 
    services, or resources over a network.

Server have two types :- 
-   Normal / Tradition server (eg. EC2 )
-   Serverless server (eg. Lambda)

Difference between Normal server & serverless server ?
-   Normal server can be real or virtual machine where we can manage everything like.
    OS,Ports, Process, Memory. Here our server is always in running state.
-   On other hand, in serverless running on demand in a container, after complete his execution 
    process again will down or stop.

How client send request to the server ?
-   A client sends a request to the server by using network protocols where TCP first establishes 
    a connection, then application-level protocols like HTTP or HTTPS define how the request is 
    formatted, then tcp will break the request in different packet and send to the server, so the
    server can understand it and send back a response to client.

what is the role of http, https, tcp, smtp ? <------------------------- [ Still I Have Confusion In SMTP ]
-   HTTP    : formatted the request, establis connection with server and send request
-   HTTPS   : this is secure version of http, in this protocal exted encryption on data. [ same work ]
-   TCP     : this protocol is responsible to break request in different small packets and in serial manner.
-   SMTP    : this protocol is mainly used to send email.
