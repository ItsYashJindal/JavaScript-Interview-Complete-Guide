1.  How node.js handle concurrently multiple request even though its single threaded ? 
👉  Node.js is using event loop to handle all multiple concurrently request. when node.js received 
    long operation it will handle asynchronously in background and start handling another request, 
    once background operation is complete. eventloop picks the response and send to the user.

2.  what is currying ?
👉  currying is that function which return an function until the function get all his arguments

3.  For in and For of Loop difference ?
👉  for in loop we are using to iterate on objects, and for of loop method 
    we are most commanly used to handle array data type, this loop is controlable and 
    async operation friendly, as well it supports return, break and continue keyword to control 
    iterations

4.  what is the best way to handle asynchronous task in loop ? 
👉  for of loop is the best to work with asynchronous task over than other loop becuase 
    * for in loop is working based on keys so thats why we are not using with arrays
    * for each loop is not controlable and it not await so thats why we are not consider to 
      use for async operation.
    * for of loop we can stop with using keywords like return and break, also its more redable and 
      asyn operation friendly.

5.  what is the difference between spread and rest operator ? 
👉  spread operator is used to break an array or object into an single independant element, but on
    other hand with rest operator is will use to collect all values in a single array. 

6.  what is the method of Deep copy ?
👉  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) |----------- OR -----------| structuredClone(obj)

7.  How Browser event loop is different from node event loop ? 
👉  In browser event loop is used to handle dom event and ui rendring, async task with the help of
    bowser api but in term of node js event loop is libuv to handle all multiple asynchronous 
    operations.

9.  How class constructor works ?
👉  a class constructor is an special type of function which runs automatically when object created from
    class. it commanly used to set or instialization the value.

10. what is the difference between json and bson ?
👉  JSON is format which is used to transfer and store data in key value pair in object, it human 
    readable. in BSON data will get stored in binary form which is used by mongodb to store data 
    in more efficiently.

11. How database will process when create index ?
👉  after create index database will create a different data structure for those key and save 
    refrence for those values in that particular row , so when next time if any query will run 
    then database will not scan the whole table, he will going to direct scan of those data.

12. what is buffer clashes ?
13. what is streams ?

14. what is high order function ? 
👉  High order functions are that function which takes another function as an argument and return 
    a value or an another function. like map, reduce, filter are an high order function.

15. what is hoisting and clousers ? 
👉  Hoisting is the natural behaviour of javascript, where before execution synchronous code every 
    variable and declaration are move on top of the code. these behavior called an hoisting in javascript

👉  clousers are that function which remeber and can access variable from outer function even execution 
    finish.

16. what is role of libuv in event loop ? 
👉  Libuv is responsible to run eventloop, it devide the all async operations in different phases like
    timer, poll, and check. once those operations are finished it moves on the own queues of each phases
    and event loop check continuously is call stack empty or not, if its empty then pick the all 
    operation form phases and put them in call stack for execution.

17. what is event emitter ?
👉  Event emitter is used to create an custom event based function. these function is called on trigger of 
    specific event. from another function, there we have some of methods to register events we can use
    method of emitter.on and for listen/ execution have mehtod of emitter.emit.

18. what is api gateway ? 

19. what is microservices ?
👉  microservices is architectural approch where we are deviding the whole application in each different
    services. where every services have own codebase and database , which scales independantly. and every
    services communicate by using message event or by api.

20. why we should choose mongodb for store data of application over the other database ?
👉  MongoDB is chosen when an application needs flexible data structure and fast development. It allows u
    to store data in JSON-like documents without a fixed schema, so changing data structure is easy.
    MongoDB works well for applications with large and unstructured data, high read/write traffic, and 
    less complex relationships. For highly relational and transactional systems, relational databases are
    usually a better choice.

21. what is destructuring ? 
22. How we will use unit testing of code base ? 

23. what is the difference between hashing and encryption ?
👉  Encryption is reversible, it used to secure data so if we need data back to the original form
    then we can convert back into the original form, while hashing is irreversible, we could not 
    convert back into the original form after encryption, we just can compare the both values where 
    we are getting the output in form of boolean only.

24. difference between spawn() and fork() ?
25. How do you handle memory leak ?
26. what is vloom ? 

27. what is throatling ? 
👉  Throatling is a technique which makes our api more secure, it used to block those request who is 
    requresting the api over the limit. throatling will restore the limit after some time. It helps to 
    protect the server from overload and misuse.

28. what if mongodb primary nord will crash how it will handle ? 
👉  If the MongoDB primary node crashes, the replica set automatically starts an election.
    Secondary nodes vote, and the node with the most up-to-date data becomes the new primary.
    This process happens automatically with minimal downtime.

29. what if multiple users update the same document again and again then how mongodb handle the request.
👉  

30. How Database replication will work ?
👉

31. what is the difference between soap and rest apis ?
👉  SOAP is a protocol with strict standards and uses XML only, 
    SOAP has built-in security and transaction support. it commanly used for build banking and 
    enterprise level application.

👉  While REST is lightweight and we can use JSON, XML, or other formats, 
    and REST is simpler, faster, and commonly used for web and mobile APIs.

32. what is the difference between serverless server and normal server ? 
33. what is lambda ?
34. How api cancellation works ? 
35. what is the role of process object in child process management ?
36. what is trigger in mysql ? 
37. what is the difference from socket.io/ socket/ websocket ? 
38. How database will doing fast filtering after create index ? 
39. How many types of indexing is there ?
40. what work flow javascript follow to complete his task FIFO Or LIFO ?
41. what is worker threads ? 
42. what is process.nextTick() ? 
43. what is thread poll ?  
44. what is shalow copy and deep copy ?
45. What is the use of cluster ?
46.  what is decorator and instructor in nestjs ?
47.  what is graphql ?
