1. Is javascript multi threaded \or single threaded ?, and if javascript is single threaded, then how
node js is able to handle parllel concurrently request in single time ?

2. what is difference bettween in brower/ javascript/ nodejs event loop ?

3. what work flow javascript follow to complete his task FIFO Or LIFO ?

4. what is process.nextTick and how it works ?

5. How shalow copy and deep copy works, and what is the method of both ?

let arr1 = [1,2,4,5];
let arr2 = [...arr1];

now we need to tell arr2 is shalow copy or deep copy ? 

6. if we try to replace an index with value instead of replace the is added on that specific address
and other element will move on next address, why its happend ?

7. they given an statement 

console.log('hello')
process.nextTick(()=>{ console.log('hello 2')});
setTimeOut(()=>{ console.log('hello 3)}, 0);
setImidiate(()=>{ console.log('hello world')});

why sequence is changed of print messages ? 

8. suppose you have to peroform any async operation from an array which loop you fill use ?

9. Which runs first: Promise or setTimeout?
👉 Promise runs first because it goes to the Microtask Queue, which has higher priority than the Callback Queue.

10. Is the Event Loop multi-threading?
👉 No. JavaScript is single-threaded. The Event Loop only manages asynchronous tasks.

11. async/await belongs to which queue?
👉 Microtask Queue, because async/await is based on Promises.

12. Why does Microtask Queue have higher priority?
👉 To complete Promise-related tasks first and keep data consistent.

13. When does the Event Loop run?
👉 When the Call Stack becomes empty.

14. Why is Call Stack important?
👉 It executes synchronous JavaScript code line by line.

15. Which queue do DOM events go to?
👉 Callback (Macrotask) Queue.

16. Does setTimeout(0) execute immediately?
👉 No. It runs only after the Call Stack is empty and microtasks are completed.
